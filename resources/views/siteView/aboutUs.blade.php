						With ever increasing traffic going out to buy things is quite a hassle and it is even more troublesome if you are not sure whether the product is available or not. In case of medicines not knowing where the medicine can be found can result in dangerous situations. Preventing such dangerous situations is what motivates us to build the online pharmacy system. With this system people can easily locate the closest pharmacy’s which have the drug they are looking for. To further make things easier for the customer the system will allow online ordering of medicines for home delivery. This way people won’t have to waste their time in traffic and neither will they have to face the disappointment of not finding the medicine at the pharmacy.
